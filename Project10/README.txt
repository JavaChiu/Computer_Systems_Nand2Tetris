Project10 JackSyntaxAnalyzer

##########################################################################

This is my implementation of Nand2Tetris project10 JackSyntaxAnalyzer.

0) Usage
Under the /src directory, there is a project10.jar executable jar file,
under command linem type in 

java -jar project10.jar "target jack file/directory"

Then it will generate the out put xmls in the same directory.

1) Source and Packaging
The source code is under the /src/project10/ directory. With packaging, 
you will need to use an MANIFEST.MF or other jar cmd to package it. More
information can be found on Oracle website,

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/

2) Reference
From my point of view, this project is the hardest so far, even after 
working on the worksheet Professor gave in class was still not enough, 
so I used some resouce online. Here I will include the references.

a. The Elements of Computing Systems, Chapter 10
With all the declaration of APIs and supposed implementation strategies.

b. Regextester.com, https://www.regextester.com/15
To help me clarify my thoughts and the regular expressions for parsing

c. Github repository, https://github.com/xctom/Nand2Tetris
To see what are other's implementations for better approach.
