This is my implementation of the hdl files in Nand2Tetris
project 5. I think the hardest part is the CPU as Professor
also mentioned in class. However, it's fun to piece all we've
studied so far together. Now I totally understand the connection
between the hack language and how the CPU translate and 
implement the command.
