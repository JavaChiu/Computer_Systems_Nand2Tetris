This is a jack program that will play a game called "The Ultimate Password",
in which the game host can set the password, and let the players guess it.
For each missing guess will make the section smaller until someone guess 
the right number.

For this game, it doesn't involve much animation, more with the interactions
between users' input. Nevertheless, I tried to add some animation to make 
the game more visualized and fun, e.g. the count down each time a user guess
a number, and the bomb image in the end. I think it's good practice overall
to be familiar with the jack language api. 

Hope you enjoy!
