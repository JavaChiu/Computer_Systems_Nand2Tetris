The first hurdle I came accross was the implementation of "Bit". Even 
though I had tried the hint on slide/text book, but still need more to
have a thorough understanding of the HDL language, especially for the
outputs in the later lines can be the inputs of previous lines. This is
not so much intuitive to me, but a good way to understand how to perform
the time lapse in the language.

The second one was the RAM8, as it wasn't that explicit to me about the
idea. I watched some explanation online, that helped clear my mind,

Later on with other RAM chips were easier after the first one, to me, they
were like creating arrays with different dimesions.

PC was fine as I just thought the conditions backward to see which was
the most significant and which the least.
