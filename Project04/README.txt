Project4

-------------------------------------------------------------

This is my implementation of the asm files in Nand2Tetris
project4. The mutiplyer one was fine, thinking of it as a low
level of machine and did the math in the basics way. The fill
one was harder and need more effort to me. I went back to check
the textbook about how the screen memory was located, suffered 
a bit, but the result looked good. It's more practice than the
sheet we had done in class. 

I know I probably won't have to include the hack files, but
just in case and safty.
