Project2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The chips in project2 are generally easy, except the ALU. The practice
in class makes it less hard, but I have trouble thinking up the last
2 outputs, equals 0 or less than 0, as it doesn't mentioned in class and 
need moew knowlegde in the HDL language basic. Overall, it is not too bad.
